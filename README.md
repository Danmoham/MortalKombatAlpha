# MortalKombat

This is a small program I have made using the terminal, I have created this to help improve my functions and learn how functions can connect together, it also has multiple modes like a quiz and a battle mode! I have improved on the battle mode in the adventure game, there is also a rock paper scissors type element with the different types of characters that effect different stats! Please feel free to comment for any improvements I can make :)
